    The city of Chicago is home to nearly 3 million people, and is the third most populous city in the 
    US. Owing to this massive population, a range of transport options are available to its denizens.

    One of these is Divvy, a bike-sharing system, complete with hundreds of stations and thousands of bikes & scooters. 

    Generously, Divvy's trip data has been made publicly available, and we've used it to produce this service.
