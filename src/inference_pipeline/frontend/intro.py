    The city of Chicago is home to nearly 3 million people, and is the third most populous city in the 
    US. Owing to this massive population, a range of transport options are available to its denizens.

    One of these is Divvy, a bike-sharing system, complete with hundreds of stations and thousands of 
    bikes & scooters. 

    Generously, Divvy's trip data has been made publicly available, and I've used it to build an end-to-end machine 
    learning system that provides this service.

    Take a look at the "Predictions" page, where we provide the main results of the model: the predicted number of 
    arrivals and departures per hour at various Divvy stations in the city.
