# Divvy Bikes Demand Predictor

## Introduction

The city of Chicago is home to nearly 3 million people, and it is currently the third most populous city in the US. Furthermore, its Cook County is the second most populous county in the country. Owing to this massive population, there are a range of transport options in the city. One of these is the city's [Divvy Bike-sharing system](https://divvybikes.com/), complete with hundreds of stations and thousands of bikes & scooters. It is currently operated by the ride-sharing company [Lyft](https://www.lyft.com/), and has been in existence for 9 years. With this many trips taking place every day for this long, this makes Divvy's [historical trip data](https://divvybikes.com/system-data) an attractive source of time-series data (at least for me :D), especially because the data is updated monthly.


## The Business Problem

The problem boils down to this: **how can we predict the amount of demand for these bikes in each area of the city?** Being able to spot spikes in demand like this will enable Divvy to determine how many bikes it would be appropriate to provide in each area. This will allow the the City of Chicago to devote its resources more economically by facilitating the provision of an appropriate number of bikes for each area. It will also help the managers of Divvy to plan any possible expansions of their services in a given area.
