# Divvy Bikes Demand Predictor

## Introduction

The city of Chicago is home to nearly 3 million people, and it is currently the third most populous city in the US. Furthermore, its Cook County is the second most populous county in the country. Owing to this massive population, there are a range of transport options in the city. One of these is the city's [Divvy Bike-sharing system](https://divvybikes.com/), complete with hundreds of stations and thousands of bikes & scooters. It is currently operated by the ride-sharing company [Lyft](https://www.lyft.com/), and has been in existence for 9 years. With this many trips taking place every day for this long, this makes Divvy's [historical trip data](https://divvybikes.com/system-data) an attractive source of time-series data.


## The Business Problem

The aforementioned data details the trips from Q1 of 2014, until November 2023 (as of 18th December 2023).
