# This folder serves as the final resting place for two defunct notebooks:

### - DATA_CLEANING.ipynb
### -TRANSFORM_CLEANED_DATA_INTO_TS_DATA.ipynb


## The data cleaning notebook was created to prototype code intended to clean 2023's data. However, the code was then placed in a single function, allowing it to be called later (see for example the notebook named "03_TRANSFORM_RAW_DATA_INTO_TRAINING_DATA.ipynb" in the "active" folder). 

## TRANSFORM_CLEANED_DATA_INTO_TS_DATA.ipynb served as the basis for some of the functions in data_transformations.py. Its contents, in combination with those of DATA_CLEANING.ipynb were used in 03_TRANSFORM_RAW_DATA_INTO_TRAINING_DATA.ipynb. This allowed me to clean and transform the result into training data in one notebook, thereby rendering TRANSFORM_CLEANED_DATA_INTO_TS_DATA.ipynb redundant.
